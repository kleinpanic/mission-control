# Mission Control Environment Configuration
# Copy to .env.local and fill in your values:
#   cp .env.example .env.local

# Server-side gateway URL (used by API routes and WebSocket proxy)
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:18789

# Gateway authentication token (get from ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json → gateway.auth.token)
# This is NEVER sent to the browser — the server proxy uses it to authenticate with the gateway.
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-token-here

# Mission Control password (optional, recommended for LAN/remote access)
# If set, users must enter this password to access Mission Control.
# If unset, no authentication is required (safe for localhost-only use).
# MISSION_CONTROL_PASSWORD=your-password-here

# Server port (default: 3333)
MISSION_CONTROL_PORT=3333

# Client-side gateway URL override (OPTIONAL)
# Leave unset to auto-detect. The app always connects via the server proxy
# (/api/gateway/ws) which handles gateway auth server-side.
# Only set this if you need a custom WebSocket endpoint.
